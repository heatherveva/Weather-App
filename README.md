## Description

This weather application was built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap.

When the user arrives on the weather dashboard application, there is a search bar on the left side of the screen. When the user searches a city, they are presented with the current and future conditions for that city. That city is also added to their search history directly below the search bar.

When the user views the current weather conditions, they are presented with the city name, the date, an icon of the weather, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.

The UV index is color coded green for favorable, yellow/orange for moderate, and red for severe.

The future, five day forecast displays the date, an icon of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.

The search history is clickable so the user can easily access the weather conditions for their past searches.
